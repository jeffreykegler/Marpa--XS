Marpa::XS::Grammar - Marpa grammars

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $grammar = Marpa::XS::Grammar->new(
        {   start   => 'Expression',
            actions => 'My_Actions',
            default_action => 'first_arg',
            rules   => [
                { lhs => 'Expression', rhs => [qw/Term/] },
                { lhs => 'Term', rhs => [qw/Factor/] },
                { lhs => 'Factor', rhs => [qw/Number/] },
                { lhs => 'Term', rhs => [qw/Term Add Term/], action => 'do_add' },
                {   lhs    => 'Factor',
                    rhs    => [qw/Factor Multiply Factor/],
                    action => 'do_multiply'
                },
            ],
        }
    );

    $grammar->precompute();

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To create a Marpa grammar object,
use the C<new> method.
Rules and symbols may be specified when the grammar is created.

To change a Marpa grammar object,
use the C<set> method.
New rules may be added until a grammar is precomputed.

A grammar cannot be used for parsing until it is precomputed.
To precompute a Marpa grammar object,
use the C<precompute> method.
After precomputation,
no new rules may added and
most other changes are forbidden.

=head2 Symbol names

Symbol names that end in right square brackets
are reserved for Marpa's internal use.
Any other valid Perl string is an acceptable
symbol name.

=head2 Terminal symbols

If a grammar has no empty rules, all symbols are terminals by default.
Unlike most parser generators,
Marpa will allow terminals to appear on the left
hand side of rules.
Marpa defines a B<terminal> as a symbol which is valid as an
input token symbol.

Marpa allows direct marking of terminals
using
the L<C<terminals> named argument|/"terminals">,
and the L<C<terminal> property|/"terminal">.
If any terminal is directly marked, only directly marked
symbols will be terminals.

Marpa's behavior can be changed by unsetting
the L<C<lhs_terminals> named argument|/"lhs_terminals">.
When the L<C<lhs_terminals> named argument|/"lhs_terminals"> is unset,
only symbols which do not appear on the LHS of a rule can be terminals.
If no symbols are directly marked, Marpa will implicitly
mark all the non-LHS symbols as terminals.

Marpa is stricter for grammars with empty rules --
it does not allow them to take the default.
There is an efficiency hit whenever
the LHS of an empty rule is a terminal as well,
so Marpa does not allow this to happen by default --
the user has to be explicitly indicate that that is
what she wants.
If a grammar has any empty rules,
it must either directly mark its terminals,
or must unset 
the L<C<lhs_terminals> named argument|/"lhs_terminals">.

One advantage of not taking the default is efficiency.
Precomputation is faster for grammars
which mark their terminals.
Also, the recognizer checks that input tokens are
terminals, so that being selective about which symbols
are terminals and which are not can allow better input checking.

=head3 Summary

The following summarizes the logic which determines
whether a symbol C<S> is terminal.
As a reminder,
a symbol is said to be B<directly marked as a terminal>
if it is one of the symbols in the
L<C<terminals> named argument|/"terminals">,
or if the symbol has the L<C<terminal> property|/"terminal"> set.

=over

=item * If any symbol is directly marked as a terminal,
then a symbol C<S> is a terminal if and only if it is also directly marked
as a terminal.

=item * If no symbol is directly marked as a terminal,
and the L<C<lhs_terminals> named argument|/"lhs_terminals"> is unset,
then all non-LHS symbols are terminals.

=item * If the grammar contains no empty rules,
no symbol is directly marked as a terminal,
and the L<C<lhs_terminals> named argument|/"lhs_terminals"> is set or
left at its default,
then all symbols are terminals.

=item * The only case not covered above is that in which
a grammar contains one or more empty rules,
no symbol is directly marked as a terminal,
and the L<C<lhs_terminals> named argument|/"lhs_terminals"> is set or
left at its default.
This is a fatal error.

=back

=head2 Sequence rules

It is very common in a grammar for one symbol to produce a
repeating sequence.
Marpa allows a shorthand for this:
sequence rules.
The RHS of a sequence rule will be repeated,
as specified by the C<min> rule property.
In sequence rules the RHS must always be one symbol
in length,
and that symbol may not be a nullable symbol.

A rule is a sequence rule if the C<min> rule property is defined.
C<min> can be 0 or 1, and specifies the minimum number of times
that the sequence is allowed to repeat.
As of this writing,
the maximum number of repetitions is always infinite.

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Marpa::XS::Grammar min 0 sequence example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    { lhs => 'sequence', rhs => ['item'], min => 0 }

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

A C<min> of zero indicates a sequence that repeats zero or more times.
This is the equivalent of using the star quantifier
("C<*>") in the
standard regular expression notation.

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Marpa::XS::Grammar min 1 sequence example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    { lhs => 'sequence', rhs => ['item'], min => 1 }

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

A C<min> of one indicates a sequence that repeats one or more times.
This is the equivalent of using the plus quantifier
("C<+>") in the
standard regular expression notation.

Sequences can have a separator, specified
with the C<separator> rule property.
By default, separation is Perl-style:
trailing separators are allowed.
In "C<proper>" separation,
a separator must actually separate
two sequence items
and therefore is not allowed
after the last item of a sequence.
If you prefer "C<proper>" separation,
you can set
the C<proper> rule property.

=head3 Advantages of sequence rules

You are never forced to use sequence rules,
but it's usually better if you do.
When a sequence is written as a sequence rule,
Marpa optimizes it.

When a sequence is written using non-sequence
rules, the semantics typically wind up being spread
over two or three Perl closures.
The semantic action for a sequence rule
is a single Perl closure.
Putting the semantics into
a single Perl closure often results in
simpler and more
natural code.
See L<the section on sequences in the semantics
document|Marpa::XS::Semantics/"Sequence Rule Nodes">.

=head3 Caveats

Marpa throws an exception if you try to use a nullable symbol
as the right hand side of a sequence rule,
or as the separator for a sequence rule.
The ban on nullables in sequences only applies to sequences
when they are written using sequence rules.
Nothing prevents you from specifying a sequence of nullables using non-sequence rules.
But usually there is no good reason to do this,
and sequences of nullable can be highly ambiguous,
which makes them
a good thing to avoid
for efficiency reasons.

To keep things simple,
the right hand side of a sequence rule must be a single symbol.
Of course, applications will often want to repeat sequences of multiple symbols.
That is easy to do indirectly:

=for Marpa::XS::Display

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $grammar = Marpa::XS::Grammar->new(
        {   start   => 'Expression',
            actions => 'My_Actions',
            default_action => 'first_arg',
            rules   => [
                { lhs => 'Expression', rhs => [qw/Term/] },

                {   lhs    => 'Factor',
                    rhs    => [qw/Factor Multiply Factor/],
                    action => 'do_multiply'
                },
            ],
        }
    );

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

C<Marpa::XS::Grammar::new> 
returns a new Marpa grammar object or throws an exception.
The arguments to
C<Marpa::XS::Grammar::new> are
references to hashes of named arguments.
In each key/value pair of this hash,
the hash key is the argument name
and the hash value is the value of
the named argument.
The available named arguments are described
L<below|/"NAMED ARGUMENTS">.

=head1 MUTATORS

=head2 precompute

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $grammar->precompute();

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

The C<precompute> method
compiles data structures that the recognizer will need.
It
returns the grammar object or throws an exception.

=head2 set

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Grammar set Synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $grammar->set( { trace_file_handle => $trace_fh } );

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

The arguments to the
C<set> method are
references to hashes of named arguments.
The available named arguments are described
L<below|/"NAMED ARGUMENTS">.
C<set> either returns true or throws an exception.

=head1 ACCESSORS

=head2 check_terminal

Returns a Perl true when its argument is the name of a terminal symbol.
Otherwise, returns a Perl false.
Not often needed,
but a lexer may find this
the most convenient way to determine if a symbol is a terminal.

=head1 TRACE ACCESSORS

=head2 show_AHFA

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: show_AHFA Synopsis
perltidy: '-dcsc -sil=0'

    print $grammar->show_AHFA()
        or die "print failed: $ERRNO";

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Not of interest to most users.
Returns a multi-line string listing the states of
an internal data structure called the
Aycock-Horspool Finite Automaton.
Not useful before the grammar is precomputed.

=head2 show_problems

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: show_problems Synopsis
perltidy: '-dcsc -sil=0'

    print $grammar->show_problems()
        or die "print failed: $ERRNO";

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Usually the application does not call this method
directly.
Returns a string describing any serious but non-fatal
problems a grammar had in the precomputation phase.
A serious problem is one that will prevent parsing.
Warnings are not serious problems in this sense.
If there were no serious problems, returns a string saying so.
This method is not useful before precomputation.

In Marpa, most serious grammar problems are
not immediately thrown as exceptions.
This is because there can be a number of serious
problems in a grammar, particularly one that is large
or in an early draft.
If each serious problem
caused an immediate exception,
the user would have to
fix them one at a time
-- very tedious.

The recognizer
throws an exception
when the user attempts
to create a parse from
a grammar with serious problems.
When that happens,
the string returned by C<show_problems> is part of the
error message.

=head2 show_rules

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: show_rules Synopsis
perltidy: '-dcsc -sil=0'

    print $grammar->show_rules()
        or die "print failed: $ERRNO";

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Returns a string listing the rules.
Each rule is shown with B<comments> which
indicate either rule properties
or internal settings.
C<show_rules> is useful in debugging grammars.

Marpa does extensive rewriting of its grammars,
and both the original rules and the rewritten rules
appear in the C<show_rules> list.
When a rule is rewritten, the original rule is
often not used.
In that case, "C<!used>" will be one of the comments
for the original rule.
The "C<!used>" comment also marks rules not used
for reasons other than rewrites.
For example,
inaccessible and unproductive rules are also
marked "C<!used>".

The "C<discard_sep"> comment indicates that the rule
discards separators
This is only
relevant in sequence rules.
Other comments indicate
whether rules
were nullable, unproductive, inaccessible, or empty.

The C<vlhs>, C<vrhs> and C<real> comments
show rule settings relevant in tracking "virtual"
internal symbols.
These are used internally,
to optimize evaluation.

=head2 show_symbols

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: show_symbols Synopsis
perltidy: '-dcsc -sil=0'

    print $grammar->show_symbols()
        or die "print failed: $ERRNO";

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Returns a string listing the symbols, along with comments
indicating whether they were
terminal, nulling, nullable, unproductive or inaccessible.
Also shown is a list of rules with that symbol on the left hand side,
and a list of rules which have that symbol anywhere on the right hand side.
Useful for debugging grammars.

=head1 NAMED ARGUMENTS

=head2 action_object

The C<action_object> named argument
specifies a class name to be used
in resolving action names to Perl closures.
A C<new> constructor must be defined
in the C<action_object> package.
It will be used to create the per-parse-tree variables.
Details are in
L<the document on semantics|Marpa::XS::Semantics>.

=head2 actions

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

            actions => 'My_Actions',

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

The C<actions> named argument specifies
the Perl package that Marpa will use when resolving
action names to Perl closures.
If both an 
C<actions> named argument and an
C<action_object> named argument are specified,
the 
package from the C<actions> named argument
is the only one used to resolve action names.
The C<actions> package is treated only as a package,
and not as a class.
Any C<new> constructor in the C<actions> package is ignored.
Details are given in
L<the document on semantics|Marpa::XS::Semantics>.

=head2 default_action

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

            default_action => 'first_arg',

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

The C<default_action> named argument specifies
the value action name
for rules without an L<C<action> property|/"action">.
Details are given in
L<the document on semantics|Marpa::XS::Semantics>.

=head2 default_null_value

The C<default_null_value> named argument specifies
the null value for
symbols
without a L<C<null_value> property|/"null_value">.
Details are given in
L<the document on semantics|Marpa::XS::Semantics>.

=head2 inaccessible_ok

The value must be a reference to an array of symbol names.
By default, Marpa warns if a symbol is inaccessible, but
the warning is suppressed for any symbol named in the array.
Setting the C<inaccessible_ok> named argument
after grammar precomputation is useless,
and itself results in a warning.

Inaccessible symbols are symbols which cannot be derived from
the start symbol, and which therefore can never be part of a
successful parse.
Inaccessible symbols often indicate errors in grammar
design.
But a user may have plans for these symbols,
may wish to keep them as notes,
or may simply wish to deal with them later.

=head2 infinite_action

Takes as its value a string specifying what Marpa
should do if it discovers that
its grammar is infinitely
ambiguous.
The value must be one of
"C<fatal>",
"C<warn>" or
"C<quiet>".
A grammar is B<infinitely ambiguous> if there
is some input for which it produces
an endless number of parses.

If the value is "C<fatal>",
Marpa throws an exception when it encounters
an infinitely ambiguous grammar.
This is the default and
will usually be what the user wants.
In most cases,
an infinitely ambiguous grammar is simply a mistake.

"C<quiet>" indicates that
the user wants to allow
infinitely ambiguous grammars.
"C<warn>" indicates that
the user wants to allow
infinitely ambiguous grammars, but
wants a warning message to be printed
to the trace file handle.

=head2 lhs_terminals

The value of the C<lhs_terminals> named argument is a Boolean.
If true, symbols which appear on the LHS of a rule are allowed
to be terminals.
C<lhs_terminals> is true by default.

If C<lhs_terminals> is unset and no symbols are directly marked
as terminals, Marpa will mark all non-LHS symbols as terminals.
If any symbol is directly marked, all terminals must be directly
marked.
If C<lhs_terminals> is unset,
but some symbols are directly marked,
it is a fatal error for a terminal to appear on the LHS of a rule.
For more, see
L<the discussion of terminals above|/"Terminal symbols">.

=head2 rules

The value of the
C<rules> named argument is a reference to an array of
B<rule descriptors>.
The C<rules> named argument may be specified multiple times,
adding new rules to the grammar each time.
New rules may be added until the grammar is precomputed.
The format of rule descriptors is L<explained
below|/"RULE DESCRIPTORS">.

=head2 start

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    start => 'Expression',

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

The value of the C<start> named argument must be a symbol name.
It will be used as the start symbol for the grammar.
The C<start> named argument is required.

=head2 symbols

The value of the C<symbols> named
arguments must be a reference to a hash.
In each key/value pair of this hash,
the hash key is the symbol property name
and the hash value is the
symbol descriptor.
Symbol descriptors are described L<below|/"SYMBOL DESCRIPTORS">.

Note that the value of C<symbols> named argument is a hash,
but the value of the C<rules> named argument is an array.
This is because symbol names make convenient hash keys.
For rules, there is no equally natural choice for a hash key.

=head2 terminals

The value of the C<terminals> named argument
must be a reference to an array of symbol names.
Specifying a symbol's name in a
C<terminals> named argument
is one way of
B<directly marking> it as a terminal.
See
L<the discussion of terminals above|/"Terminal symbols">.

=head2 trace_file_handle

The value is a file handle.
Trace output and warning messages
go to the trace file handle.
By default the trace file handle is C<STDERR>.

=head2 trace_rules

Traces rules as they are added to the grammar.
Useful, but you will usually
prefer the C<show_rules> method.
A C<trace_rules> setting becomes effective
within the named argument hash which sets it.
A trace message warns the user if he turns
on rule tracing when
rules have already been added.

=head2 unproductive_ok

The value must be a reference to an array of symbol names.
By default, Marpa warns if a symbol is unproductive, but
the warning is suppressed for any symbol named in the array.
Setting the C<unproductive_ok> named argument
after grammar precomputation is useless,
and itself results in a warning.

Unproductive symbols are symbols which can never derive
a sentence.
(A sentence is a string of zero or more terminals.)
That means that unproductive symbols can never be part
of a successful parse.
Unproductive symbols often indicate errors in grammar
design.
But a user may have plans for these symbols,
may wish to keep them as notes,
or may simply wish to deal with them later.

=head2 warnings

The value is a boolean.
Warnings are written to the trace file handle.
By default, warnings are on.
Usually, an application will want to leave them on.
If warnings are turned off,
turning them back on
after grammar precomputation is useless,
and itself results in a warning.

=head1 RULE DESCRIPTORS

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    rules => [
        { lhs => 'Expression', rhs => [qw/Term/] },
        { lhs => 'Term',       rhs => [qw/Factor/] },
        { lhs => 'Factor',     rhs => [qw/Number/] },
        { lhs => 'Term', rhs => [qw/Term Add Term/], action => 'do_add' },
        {   lhs    => 'Factor',
            rhs    => [qw/Factor Multiply Factor/],
            action => 'do_multiply'
        },
    ],

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

=head2 Rule descriptors as hashes

The long form descriptor of a rule is a
reference to a hash
of B<rule properties>.
In each key/value pair of this hash,
the hash key is the rule property name
and the hash value is the value of
that property.

=head2 action

The value of the C<action> rule property is a string which
specifies the semantics for the rule.
For details, see
L<the document on semantics|Marpa::XS::Semantics>.

The semantics of nulling symbols are dealt with on a per-symbol
basis, rather than a per-rule basis.
For this reason the
C<action> rule property is useless
for empty rules.
An exception is thrown if an C<action> property
is defined for an empty rule.

=head2 keep

Separators in sequence rules
are usually not semantically
significant.
By default,
Marpa throws away
separators during parse tree traversal and
before node evaluation time,
so that the semantic actions
do not see the separators.

If the value of the C<keep> rule property
is a Perl true, Marpa keeps separators.
This allows the semantic actions to examine them.
The downside
is that the
work of distinguishing
sequence separators from sequence items
is pushed into the semantic actions.
For details about the semantics, see
L<the document on semantics|Marpa::XS::Semantics>.

=head2 lhs

The value of the C<lhs> rule property must be a string containing
the name of the rule's left hand side symbol.
Every Marpa rule must have a left hand side symbol.

The C<lhs> plays a role in the semantics.
If no C<action> rule property is defined,
Marpa looks in either the
grammar's C<actions> package
or the grammar's C<action_object>
for a Perl closure that has
the name of the C<lhs> symbol.
For details, see
L<the document on semantics|Marpa::XS::Semantics>.

=head2 min

C<min> must be 0, 1, or undefined.
If C<min> is 0 or 1, 
the rule is a B<sequence rule>.
If C<min> is undefined, the rule is an ordinary, B<non-sequence rule>.

Only one symbol,
called the B<sequence item>,
is allowed on the right hand side of a sequence rule.
The sequence item
may not be a nullable symbol.
The input will be required to match
the sequence item
at least C<min> times
and will be allowed to match
the sequence item
an unlimited number of times.

=head2 null_ranking

C<null_ranking> is ignored unless
the recognizer's C<ranking_method> named argument
is set to something other than its default.
The C<null_ranking> named argument allows the application
to control the order in which rules with nullable symbols
are returned by the C<value> method.
Such rules can match the same input in several ways
depending on which symbols are nulled.
These different ways of nulling symbols in a rule
are called its null variants.

If C<null_ranking> is undefined,
the order of the null variants will be arbitrary.
This is the default,
and is acceptable to most applications.
For details on using the
C<null_ranking> named argument,
see L<the document on parse order|Marpa::XS::Semantics::Order>.

=head2 proper

By default, sequence rules with separators allow trailing
separators,
Perl-style.
If the C<proper> rule property is a Perl true,
"C<proper>" separation is enforced.
In proper separation,
separation must actually separate sequence items,
and trailing separators are not allowed.

=head2 rank

C<rank> is ignored unless
the recognizer's C<ranking_method> named argument
is set to something other than its default.
C<rank>, when specified, must be an integer.
It may be negative.
C<rank> is 0 by default.
For details on using the
C<rank> named argument,
see L<the document on parse order|Marpa::XS::Semantics::Order>.

=head2 rhs

The value of the C<rhs> property is a reference to
an array of strings containing
the names of the rule's right hand symbols,
in order.
This array may be zero length, in which case
this is an B<empty rule> --
a rule with no symbols on the right hand side.
A rule is also empty if
there is no C<rhs> specifier in its descriptor.

=head2 separator

Any sequence rule may have a C<separator> defined.
The value must be a symbol name.
By default, Marpa allows trailing separators.
This is the usual style in Perl.
The separator must not be a nullable symbol.

=head2 Rule descriptors as arrays

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Ambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    rules => [
        [ 'E', [qw/E Add E/],      'do_add' ],
        [ 'E', [qw/E Multiply E/], 'do_multiply' ],
        [ 'E', [qw/Number/], ],
    ],

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Rule descriptors may be given in "short form" --
as a reference to an array.
The elements of the array,
in order,
are
the C<lhs> property,
the C<rhs> property,
and the C<action> property.
The last two are optional.
Omission of an optional
property in a short form descriptor
has the same effect 
that omitting the same optional property would have
in the long form.

=head2 Duplicate rules

Marpa throws an exception if a duplicate rule is added.
Two rules are considered duplicates if

=over

=item * Both rules have the same left hand symbol.

=item * Both rules have the same right hand symbols in the same order.

=back

This definition applies to sequence rules, as well as to
ordinary rules.
As a consequence,
sequence rules can be considered
duplicates even when they
have different separators
and/or different minimum counts.

=head1 SYMBOL DESCRIPTORS

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Null Value Example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1
