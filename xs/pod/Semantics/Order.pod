=head1 NAME

Marpa::XS::Semantics::Order - How Marpa ranks ambiguous parses

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Marpa allows ambiguous parses.
While an unambiguous parse can produce at most one parse tree
and one parse result,
an ambiguous parse will produce a parse series.
A parse series is a sequence of parse trees,
each of which will have its own parse result.

This document describes ways of controlling
the order in which
the recognizer's
L<C<value>|Marpa::XS::Recognizer/"value">
method
evaluates the parse
trees of an ambiguous parse.
It also describes ways to exclude selected parse trees
from the parse series.

=head2 Duplicate parses are eliminated

When evaluating the parse trees in a parse series,
Marpa never evaluates the same parse tree twice.
Marpa considers two parse trees to be the same if they are
B<semantic duplicates>.

Two parse trees are semantic duplicates if
and only if
a recursive, top-down evaluation of each
applies
the same rules
in the same order
at the same earleme locations.
This definition implies that,
given any deterministic semantics,
two parse trees which are
semantic duplicates
will always produce the same parse result --
hence the term "semantic duplicates".
When the Marpa documentation refers to duplicate
parses, it will mean semantic duplicates unless otherwise
stated.

=head2 Default parse order

By calling
the recognizer's
L<C<value>|Marpa::XS::Recognizer/"value">
method
repeatedly,
Marpa can produce all the parse results
in the current parse series.
The default is for the parse results to be returned
in an arbitrary order.
This corresponds to the "C<none>" value of
L<the recognizer's C<ranking_method>|Marpa::XS::Recognizer/"ranking_method">
named argument.

=head2 Arbitrary parse order

When this document calls a behavior "arbitrary"
it means that an application
must
not rely on that behavior being repeated.
An arbitrary behavior is allowed to
change from version to version
of the software,
from run to run of the application,
and even from call to call of the methods.

"Arbitrary parse order", in particular,
means that the particular order in which
parse trees are evaluated may not be repeated.
But an application can expect,
even when the order of evaluation
of the parse trees is arbitrary,
that all appropriate parse trees
will be included in the parse series,
and that none of the parse trees in the parse series
will be the semantic duplicate of any other tree.

=head2 Ranking methods

Marpa grammar objects have L<a C<ranking_method> named
argument|Marpa::XS::Recognizer/"ranking_method">,
whose value can be the name of a ranking method,
or "C<none>", indicating that the default ranking method is to
be used.

=head2 The C<rule> ranking method

The rule method ranks alternative parses according to their rules.
Every rule has a B<rule rank>.
A rule's rank can be specified using the 
the C<rank> named
argument for that rule.
Rule ranks must be integers.
If no rule rank is specified, the rule rank is 0.
When being ranked,
parse trees
are traversed top-down, left-to-right.

=head2 The C<high_rule_only> ranking method

The C<high_rule_only> ranking method is similar to the
C<rule> ranking method, except that, at every choice point,
it discards all of the choices which
have a rank lower than that of the highest ranked alternative.

In carrying out the ranking,
the choice points of the parse trees
are visited in top-down, left-to-right order.
Since the C<high_rule_only> ranking method eliminates some
parse trees, it can reduce or eliminate the ambiguity of a parse,
but it does not necessarily do either.
This is because, at each choice point among the parse trees,
it is possible that several of the choices,
or all of them, will have the same rank
as the highest ranked alternative.

=head2 Null ranking

Some rules have a RHS which contains
B<proper nullables>:
symbols
which may be nulled, but which are not nulling
symbols.
(Nulling symbols are symbols which are B<always> nulled.)

When a rule contains proper nullables, each application
of that rule to a section of input creates a B<nulling variant> --
that rule with a specific pattern of
null and non-null symbols.
In many cases, this creates an ambiguity -- different
nulling variants could apply to the same substring of input.
In ambiguous parsings of this kind,
some applications may want to rank nulling variants that start
with non-null symbols higher.
Other applications may want to do the opposite --
to rank nulling variants that start
with null symbols higher.

The 
L<C<null_ranking> named
argument for rules|Marpa::XS::Grammar/"null_ranking">
specifies which nulling variants are ranked high or low.
Ranking of nulling variants is done left-to-right,
with the null preference as indicated by the C<null_ranking>
named argument.
Specifically, if the C<null_ranking> is "C<low>",
then the closer a nulling variant
places its B<non-null> symbols to the start of the rule,
the higher it ranks.
If the C<null_ranking> is "C<high>",
then the closer a nulling variant
places its B<null> symbols to the start of the rule,
the higher it ranks.

A rule is null ranked if and only if its C<null_ranking>
is defined.
Note that this definition means that a rule can be considered
null ranked even if it does not have any nullable symbols.
A rule which is not null ranked is called non-null-ranked.

Null ranking, in the current implementation,
is targeted at situations where the alternatives
are different applications of
a single rule.
In situations where the choice is between
two different rules,
an application which cares about the order
will typically want to
override the null ranking
using rule ranks.
A more detailed description of the rule comparison
logic can be found below.

By default, 
C<null_ranking> is undefined, which means the order
of the null variants is arbitrary.
This is fine for most applications.

=head2 Details of ranking

When ranking, the logic descends the parse trees top-down
and left-to-right.
Places where there is more than one alternative are
called B<choice points>.
Alternatives are ranked (in the C<rule> ranking method)
or selected
(in the C<high_rule_only> ranking method),
by comparing them as follows:

=over

=item * If two alternatives are for the same rule,
and that the rule is null ranked, they rank as described
under L<"Null ranking">.

=item *
If the two alternatives have the same rule,
and that rule is non-null-ranked,
the alternatives have equal rank.

=item * If the two alternatives have different rules,
and the two rules have different rule ranks,
the alternative with the higher rule rank
ranks high.

=item * The remaining cases deal with the
comparison of alternatives which have
different rules,
when both rules have the same rule rank.

=over

=item *
If the rule for one alternative is null ranked,
while the rule for the other is non-null-ranked,
the alternative with the non-null-ranked rule ranks high.

=item *
If both rules are non-null-ranked,
the two alternatives have equal rank.

=item *
If both rules are null-ranked, their ranking is arbitrary --
either one may rank high, or they may have equal rank.

=head2 A general approach to sorting parses

The most general way to sort Marpa parses is for the application
to take control.
The application can set up the Marpa semantic actions
so that the parse result of every parse tree is a
C<< <rank, true_value> >> duple.
The duples can then be sorted by C<rank>.
Once the resuls are sorted,
the C<rank> element of the duple can be discarded.
(Those familiar with the Schwartzian transform
may note a resemblance.
In Perl,
duples can be implemented as references to arrays of 2 elements.)

The user needs to be careful.
In theory, ambiguity can cause an exponential explosion in the number of results.
In practice, ambiguity tends to get out of hand very easily.
Producing and sorting all the parses can take a very
long time.

=head2 The C<constant> ranking method is no longer supported

The C<constant> ranking method is no longer implemented.
An initial attempt to find the ideal compromise
between flexibility and efficiency,
the
C<constant> ranking method
proved too ambitious, and had several drawbacks.
First, its overhead was high in comparison to the flexibility
it offered.
Second, it was not intuitive.
Even when the
C<constant> ranking method
was powerful enough to solve a problem,
it was not always obvious how to actually use it.
Finally, its implementation
was extremely complex.

The new C<rule> ranking method is far more efficient,
vastly more intuitive, and
far easier to implement and maintain.
But the new C<rule> ranking method is
also very flexible -- it passes the test suite
which was written for the C<constant> ranking method.
