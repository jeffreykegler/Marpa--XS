Marpa::XS::Recognizer - Marpa recognizers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $recce = Marpa::XS::Recognizer->new( { grammar => $grammar } );
    $recce->read( 'Number', 42 );
    $recce->read( 'Multiply', );
    $recce->read( 'Number', 1 );
    $recce->read( 'Add', );
    $recce->read( 'Number', 7 );

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To create a recognizer object, use L<the C<new> method|/new>.

To read input, use L<the C<read> method|/read>.

To evaluate a parse tree, based on the input, use L<the C<value> method|/value>.

=head2 Token streams

By default, Marpa uses the token-stream model of input.
The token-stream model is standard -- so standard the most documents about
parsing do not bother to describe it.
In the token-stream model, each read adds a token at the current location,
then advances the current location by one.
The location before any input is numbered 0
and if I<N> tokens are parsed,
they fill the locations from 1 to I<N>.

This document will describe only the token-stream model of input.
Marpa allows other models of the input, but their use
requires special method calls,
which are described in L<the
document on alternative input models|Marpa::XS::Advanced::Models>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $recce = Marpa::XS::Recognizer->new( { grammar => $grammar } );

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

The C<new> method creates a recognizer object.
The C<new> method either returns a new recognizer object or throws an exception.

The arguments to the C<new> method
are references to hashes of named
arguments.
In each key/value pair of these hashes, the key is the argument name,
and the hash value is the value of the argument.
The named arguments are described L<below|/"NAMED ARGUMENTS">.

=head1 ACCESSORS

=head2 terminals_expected

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Recognizer terminals_expected Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $terminals_expected = $recce->terminals_expected();

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Returns a reference to a list of strings,
where the strings are the
names of the terminals
acceptable at the current location.
In the default input model, the presence of a terminal
in this list means that terminal will be acceptable
in the next C<read> method call.
This is highly useful for Ruby Slippers parsing.

=head2 check_terminal

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Recognizer check_terminal Synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $is_symbol_a_terminal = $recce->check_terminal('Document');

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Returns a Perl true when its argument is the name of a terminal symbol.
Otherwise, returns a Perl false.
Not often needed.

=head1 MUTATORS

=head2 read

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $recce->read( 'Number', 42 );
    $recce->read( 'Multiply', );
    $recce->read( 'Number', 1 );
    $recce->read( 'Add', );
    $recce->read( 'Number', 7 );

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

The C<read> method reads one token at the current parse location.
It then advances the current location by 1.

C<read> takes two arguments: a B<token name> and a B<token value>.
The token name is required.
It must be the name of a valid terminal symbol.
The token value is optional.
It defaults to a Perl C<undef>.
For details about terminal symbols,
see L<Marpa::XS::Grammar/"Terminals">.

The parser may accept or reject the token.
If the parser accepted the token,
the C<read> method returns
the number of tokens which are acceptable at the new current location.
This number may be helpful in guiding L<Ruby
Slippers parsing|/"RUBY SLIPPERS PARSING">.

C<read> may return zero,
which means
that the next C<read> call must fail,
because there is no token that will be acceptable to it.
In the default input model,
where the C<read> method is the only means of inputing tokens,
a zero return from a C<read> method
means that the parse is B<exhausted> --
that no more input is possible.
More details on "exhaustion" are in L<a
section below|/"PARSE EXHAUSTION">.

Marpa may reject a token because it is not one of those
acceptable at the current location.
When this happens, C<read> returns a Perl C<undef>.
A rejected token need not end parsing --
it is perfectly possible to retry the C<read> call
with another token.
This is, in fact, an important technique in Ruby
Slippers parsing.
For details,
see L<the section on Ruby Slippers
parsing|/"RUBY SLIPPERS PARSING">.

For other failures,
including an attempt to C<read> a token
into an exhausted parser,
Marpa throws an exception.

=head2 set

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Recognizer set Synopsis
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $recce->set( { max_parses => 10, } );

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

The C<set> method's arguments are references to hashes of named
arguments.
The C<set> method
can be used to set or change named arguments after the recognizer
has been created.
Details of the named arguments are L<below|/"NAMED ARGUMENTS">.

=head2 value

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $value_ref = $recce->value;
    my $value = $value_ref ? ${$value_ref} : 'No Parse';

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Because Marpa parses ambiguous grammars, every parse
is a series of zero or more parse trees.
There are zero parse trees if there was no valid parse
of the input according to the grammar.

The C<value> method call evaluates the next parse tree
in the parse series,
and returns a reference to the parse result for that parse tree.
If there are no more parse trees,
the C<value> method returns C<undef>.

The C<value> method's arguments are references to hashes of named
arguments.
Details of the named arguments are L<below|/"NAMED ARGUMENTS">.

Several of the recognizer's named arguments are not allowed once
evaluation has begun.
Evaluation of a parse series begins with
its first C<value> method call.
As a convenience,
the named arguments
of the first C<value> method call
are treated as having been specified BEFORE
evaluation begins.

For example, the C<end> named argument,
which specifies the end of parsing location in the input
stream, may not be changed after evaluation begins.
The first C<value> call of an ambiguous parse series
may have an C<end> named argument,
and its value will apply to the entire parse series.
If any subsequent call to C<value> for that parse series
has an C<end> named argument specified,
an exception will be
thrown.

=head1 TRACE ACCESSORS

=head2 show_earley_sets

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: show_earley_sets Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    print $recce->show_earley_sets()
        or die "print failed: $ERRNO";

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

An advanced, internals-oriented tracing method,
which will not be of interest to most users.
Most users will want to use L<the C<show_progress>
method|/show_progress>
instead.
C<show_earley_sets> returns a multi-line string
listing every Earley item in every Earley set.

=head2 show_progress

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: show_progress Synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    print $recce->show_progress()
        or die "print failed: $ERRNO";

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Returns a string describing the progress of the parse.
With no arguments,
the string contains reports for
the current location.
With a single integer argument I<N>,
the string contains reports for location I<N>.
With two numeric arguments, I<N> and I<M>, the arguments are interpreted
as a range of locations and the returned string contains
reports for all locations in the range.

If an argument is negative,
I<-N>,
it indicates 
the I<N>th location counting backward
from the furthest location of the parse.
For example, if 42 was the furthest location,
-1 would be location 42 and -2 would be location 41.
For example, the method call
C<< $recce->show_progress(-3, -1) >>
returns reports for the last three locations of the parse.
The method call C<< $recce->show_progress(0, -1) >>
will print progress reports for the entire parse.

C<show_progress> is
Marpa's most powerful tool for 
debugging application grammars.
It can also be used to track the
progress of a parse or
to investigate how a parse works.
A much fuller description,
with an example,
is in
L<the document on debugging Marpa
grammars|Marpa::XS::Debug>.

=head1 NAMED ARGUMENTS

The recognizer's named arguments are
accepted by its
C<new>, C<set> and C<value> methods.
Most of these named arguments are valid everywhere,
although depending on their meaning,
they may have no effect.
For example, the C<too_many_earley_items> named
argument will have no effect after input is complete.

Some of the recognizer's named arguments
are not valid for all calls of the C<new>, C<set>
and C<value> methods,
and cause an exception if used
in the wrong one.
For example,
a C<grammar> named argument is only valid
when a recognizer is being constructed by
the C<new> method.
If a named argument can cause an exception
due to use in the wrong method call,
this is mentioned in its description below.

=head2 closures

The value of C<closures> named argument
must be
a reference to a hash.
In each key/value pair of this hash,
the key must be an action name.
The hash value
must be a CODE ref.
The C<closures> named argument
is not allowed once evaluation has begun.

When an action name is a key in
the 
C<closures> named argument,
the usual action resolution mechanism of the semantics
is bypassed.
One common use of
the C<closures> named argument is to
allow anonymous
subroutines to be semantic actions.
For more details, see L<the document on
semantics|Marpa::XS::Semantics>.

=head2 end

The C<end> named argument
specifies the parse end location.
The default is for the parse to end where the input did,
so that the parse returned is of the entire input.
The C<end> named argument is not allowed
once evaluation has begun.

=head2 grammar

The C<new> method is required to have
a C<grammar> named argument.  Its
value must be
a precomputed Marpa grammar object.
The C<grammar> named argument is not allowed anywhere else.

=head2 max_parses

The value must be an integer.
If it is greater than zero, the evaluator will
return no more than that number of parse results.
If it is zero, there will be no
limit on the number of parse results returned.
The default is for
there to be no limit.

Marpa allows extremely ambiguous grammars.
C<max_parses> 
can be used if
the user
wants to see only
the first few parse results of
an ambiguous parse.
C<max_parses> is also useful to
limit CPU usage and output length when testing
and debugging.

=head2 ranking_method

The value must be a string:
one of "C<none>",
"C<rule>",
or "C<high_rule_only>".
When the value is "C<none>", Marpa returns the parse results
in arbitrary order.
This is the default.
The C<ranking_method> named argument is not allowed
once evaluation has begun.

The "C<rule>"
and "C<high_rule_only>" ranking methods
allows the user
to control the order
in which parse results are returned by
the C<value> method,
and to exclude some parse results from the parse series.
For details, see L<the document
on parse order|Marpa::XS::Semantics::Order>.

=head2 too_many_earley_items

The C<too_many_earley_items> argument is optional.
If specified, it sets the B<Earley item warning threshold>.
If an Earley set becomes larger than the
Earley item warning threshold,
a warning is printed to the trace file handle.

Marpa parses from any BNF,
and can handle grammars and inputs which produce large
Earley sets.
But parsing that involves large Earley sets can be slow.
Large Earley sets
are something most applications can,
and will wish to, avoid.

By default, Marpa calculates
an Earley item warning threshold
based on the size of the
grammar.
The default threshold will never be less than 100.
If the Earley item warning threshold is set to 0,
warnings about large Earley sets are turned off.

=head2 trace_actions

The C<value> method's
C<trace_actions> named argument
is a boolean.
If the boolean value is true, Marpa prints tracing information
as it resolves action names to
Perl closures.
A boolean value of false turns tracing off, which is the default.
Traces are written to the trace file handle.

=head2 trace_file_handle

The value is a file handle.
Traces and warning messages
go to the trace file handle.
By default the trace file handle is inherited
from the grammar used to create the recognizer.

=head2 trace_terminals

Very handy in debugging, and often useful
even when the problem is not in the lexing.
The value is a trace level.
When the trace level is 0,
tracing of terminals is off.
This is the default.

At a trace level of 1 or higher,
Marpa produces a trace message
for each terminal as it is accepted or rejected
by the recognizer.
At a trace level of 2 or higher,
the trace messages include, for
every location, a list of the
terminals expected.
In practical grammars, output from
trace level 2 can be voluminous.

=head2 trace_values

The C<value> method's
C<trace_values> named argument
is a numeric trace level.
If the numeric trace level is 1, Marpa
prints tracing information
as values are computed in the evaluation stack.
A trace level of 0 turns value tracing off,
which is the default.
Traces are written to the trace file handle.

=head2 warnings

The value is a boolean.
Warnings are written to the trace file handle.
By default, the recognizer's warnings are on.
Usually, an application will want to leave them on.

=head1 RUBY SLIPPERS PARSING

=for Marpa::XS::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Interactive Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $recce = Marpa::XS::Recognizer->new( { grammar => $grammar } );

    my @tokens = (
        [ 'Number', 42 ],
        ['Multiply'], [ 'Number', 1 ],
        ['Add'],      [ 'Number', 7 ],
    );

    TOKEN: for ( my $token_ix = 0; $token_ix <= $#tokens; $token_ix++ ) {
        defined $recce->read( @{ $tokens[$token_ix] } )
            or fix_things( $recce, \@tokens )
            or die q{Don't know how to fix things};
    }

=for Marpa::XS::Display::End

Marpa is able to tell the application
which symbols are acceptable as tokens at the next location
in the parse.
The L<C<terminals_expected> method|/terminals_expected>
returns the list of tokens that B<will> be accepted by
the next C<read>.
The application can use this information to change the
input "on the fly"
so that it is acceptable to the parser.

An application can also take a "try it and see"
approach.
If an application is not sure whether a token is
acceptable or not, the application can
try to read the dubious token using
L<the C<read> method|/read>.
If the token is rejected,
L<the C<read> method|/read> call will return a
Perl C<undef>.
At that point,
the application can retry the C<read> with a different token.

=head2 An example

Marpa's HTML parser, L<Marpa::HTML>, is
an example of how Ruby Slippers parsing can help
with a non-trivial, real-life application.
When a token is rejected in L<Marpa::HTML>, it changes
the input to match
the parser's expectations by

=over

=item * Modifying existing tokens, and

=item * Creating new tokens.

=back

The second technique, the creation of
new "virtual" tokens,
is used
by L<Marpa::HTML>
to deal with omitted start and end tags.
The actual HTML grammar that
L<Marpa::HTML> uses takes
an oversimplified view of the HTML --
it assumes,
even when the HTML standards do not require it,
that start and end tags are always present.
For most HTML files of interest,
this assumption will be
contrary to fact.

Ruby Slippers parsing is used to make the grammar's
over-simplistic view of the world come true for it.
Whenever a token is rejected,
L<Marpa::HTML> looks at the expected tokens list.
If it sees that a start or end tag is expected,
L<Marpa::HTML> creates a token for it --
a completely new "virtual" token that gives the parser exactly what it expects.
L<Marpa::HTML> then resumes input at the point in the original input stream
where it left off.

=head1 PARSE EXHAUSTION

A parse is B<exhausted> when it will accept no more input.
In the default input model, the C<read> method indicates this
by returning zero.

An B<exhausted> parse is not necessarily a failed parse.
Grammars are often written so that once they "find what
they are looking for", no further input is acceptable.
Grammars of that kind become exhausted when they succeed.
