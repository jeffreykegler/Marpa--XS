Revision history for Marpa::XS

0.008000 Fri Jul 29 09:04:42 PDT 2011

     * Second official (ALPHA) release.

     * Parse Location is now by Earley set ordinal,
       not Earleme.  If you don't know what this means,
       it does not affect you.  For the default input
       model, earleme and Earley set ordinal are the
       same.  If you are not sure whether you are using
       the default input model, then you are.

     * Converted parse bocage to C.  This is a major
       change.

     * Copied Marpa::XS into combined Marpa repository
